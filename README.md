# Superstore Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project on the "Superstore" dataset. The project aims to analyze sales and profitability trends in a retail superstore and provide insights based on the data.

## Dataset

The "superstore" dataset used in this project consists of sales data from a fictional retail superstore. It includes information such as order details, customer information, product categories, and sales performance.

The dataset is available in the file `superstore_sales.csv`. You can find the data in the `data` directory.

## Analysis

The project includes the following analyses:

- Sales trends over time
- Profitability analysis by product category
- Customer segmentation and sales by segment

The analysis is performed using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code for the analysis can be found in the `notebooks` directory.
